Export IDF from DesignSpark.

Add height of the components by manually manipulating IDF. See datasheets at BOM.
For the capacitors and resistors that it's not clear which height is needed, choose 
the worst case of the family of the component.

Some capacitors and resistors seem to be either  rotated or not in actual width and length.
These compoents where centered and rotated, but this should NOT taken for granted because
this issue is still PENDING! This components might have to be resized instead of centered + rotated

Use two components to "emulate" the USB. One on TOP and the other on BOTTOM of the pcb.
There will be a gap in the z-coord that the pcb exists.
Take care that the resulting pair of components has correct total height (including the gap) and is placed
correctly in the z-axis
WARNING! The coordinates between these two components are mirrored! So the "left" for the one is on the "right" for the other.
Keep that in mind when manually manipulate them.

USB plug dimensions are smaller in the automatically produced IDF. Change them manually (consult datasheet)

Add PCB slots 1x1 mm to the PCB outline

PCB tolerances

USB tolerance 0.25mm added only to the "free" side (all the tolerance, not the half).
The other side is fixed to the PCB
Tolerance for widht is +/- 0.10 mm (0.05mm per side)

SD tolerance +/- 0.15mm for both width and length (0.075mm per side)

SC tolerance +/- 0.20mm for both width and length (0.10mm per side)

SC height tolerance +/- 0.10mm (worst case +0.10mm)

SD height tolerance (including the sd card) +/-0.20mm (worst case taken, +0.20mm)

USB height tolerance +/- 0.10mm (splitted in two 0.05mm, for each side)

Changed widths:
"C1206" "C-EUC1206" -> 3.2 mm
"C0603" "C-EUC0603" -> 1.6 mm
"C0603K" "C-EUC0603K" -> 1.6 mm
"R0603" "R-EU_R0603" -> 1.6 mm (towards negative-x axis)
to include the full length of these components

Changed the width of "---MJ_SOT223" "TLV1117-33CDCY" to the max according the datasheet
Added the pads of "---MJ_SOT223" "TLV1117-33CDCY" as rectangles. Their height is not mentioned 
and cannot be deduced from the datasheet so it is set to an approximation of half of the total component height

Slots' widths resized to 0.7 mm (previously 1mm). The center is kept the same

Moved USB slot 1mm up

Move USB component to match Pro's

* Changed the capacitors C1206 and C0603 to the new ones C0805 and C0603
